- Prendre en compte les caractères NULL et '%'

--- Issue du papier de scut sur les format strings ----

> Beside the exploitation itself there are some things to consider. If
> the shell- code is contained within the format string it may not
> contain `\x25' (%) or NUL bytes. But since no important opcode is in
> neither 0x25 or 0x00 you will not run into problems when
> constructing shellcode. The same is true if he addresses are stored
> on the format string, too. If an address you want o write to
> contains a NUL-byte in the least significant byte, you can replace t
> with a short-write on an odd address just below the address you want
> to tore the byte on. This is not possible on all architectures,
> though. Also, you can use two seperate format strings. The first
> creates the address you want to write to in the memory behind the
> whole string. The second uses this address to write to it.  This may
> become complicated pretty soon, but allows reliable exploita- tion
> and is sometimes worth the effort.
